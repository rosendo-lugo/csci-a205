   The program follows these steps for spam detection:
   - Reads a list of spam keywords from a file.
   - Processes the input email text to normalize it (lowercase, remove punctuation).
   - Counts the occurrences of spam keywords and non-spam words.
   - Calculates the spam-to-ham ratio and classifies the email based on predefined thresholds.
   - Outputs whether the email is likely spam, possibly spam, or not spam.
